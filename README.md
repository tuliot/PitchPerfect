## What is Pitch Perfect?
Pitch Perfect is an iOS application that allows you to record a sound, and play it back with modulation.

## Why did I build this?
This is an assignment in a course that I am taking: [Udacity iOS Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/ios-developer-nanodegree--nd003). I did, however, take some liberty with the specification of the app, and wanted to take it a step further. So I've built this in a way that will allow me to do cool things like support different themes, save sounds, and add custom modulators

## How can I use this?
I have no intention of putting this on the App Store, but please feel free to fork/clone/download the source code, compile and use. I encourage it!

## Can I contribute?
Of course! For grading purposes, I will not be merging any code from anyone until after I've recieved feedback on the assignment. But afterwards, I will keep up with any improvements made by anyone. If you do want to contribute, please feel free to check out the Issues. If there is one that you want to take, please add a comment stating so, and assign it to yourself. I also ask that you fork the repo, and submit Pull Requests so I can review the code that is being merged. If you feel there is an issue missing, feel free to write it up.
